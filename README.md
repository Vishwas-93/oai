This App was created with create-react-app

All the components have state associated with them hence using class components.


Important Features:

    1. Two way data binding (In forms)

    2. Conditional Rendering of menubar drop down

    3. Routing

    4. On submit, logs all the items in the form.

    5. csv to string once the file is uploaded is logged onto the console.



Instructions to run the Application:

    1. unzip the folder.

    2. navigate to the folder using cli and cd into the unzipped folder.

    3. run "npm install"

    4. Once all the packages are installed successfully, please type "npm start" to run the application

    5. There are three routes,
        a. "/" -> Which takes to the settings page (default route)
        b. "/settings" -> Click the settings button on menubar.
        c. "/datasets" -> Click the "My Datasets" on the menubar.

    6. "settings" page has form that supports two way data binding and reactive to clicks and logs the result on the console.

    7. "datasets" page has "upload csv" button that uploads the csv and converts it into string and prints it in the        console.

    8. It alerts if some other file is selected.

    9. This page also has a reactive form and on submit logs the results to the console. 




Known Bugs:

    1. I have used two fonts (We can use any number based on the requirements).

    2. Side menubar will be hidden in mobile. (I can add hamburger icon and make it take full width when clicked on mobile);

    3. Icons used are based on assumptions. (As they were not a part of the zipped folder provide).
